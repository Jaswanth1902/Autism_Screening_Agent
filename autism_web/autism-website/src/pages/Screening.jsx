    title: "Understanding ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorder)",
    body: "Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a developmental condition that affects how a person perceives and socializes with others, causing problems in social interaction and communication. The disorder also includes limited and repetitive patterns of behavior. The term 'spectrum' in ASD refers to the wide range of symptoms and severity."
  },
  {
    title: "The ISAA Scoring Tool",
    body: "The Indian Scale for Assessment of Autism (ISAA) is a clinical tool developed specifically for the Indian context. It evaluates a person across six key areas of daily life. This report uses an approximated version of the ISAA logic to help parents understand their child's unique developmental profile."
  },
  {
    title: "Domain Breakdown: Social Relationship",

  },
  {
    title: "Domain Breakdown: Emotional Responsiveness",
    body: "Emotional responsiveness refers to how a child reacts to their own feelings and the feelings of others. A higher score here might suggest that the child finds it difficult to show empathy or has reactions that seem detached from the situation."
  },
  {
    title: "Domain Breakdown: Speech-Language (Communication)",

  },
  {
    title: "Domain Breakdown: Behavior Patterns",

  },
  {
    title: "Domain Breakdown: Sensory Aspects",
    body: "Many individuals with autism experience the world differently. They may be hypersensitive (over-reactive) or hyposensitive (under-reactive) to sounds, lights, smells, or physical touch."
  },
  {
    title: "Domain Breakdown: Cognitive Component",
    body: "Cognitive aspects include attention, memory, and visual inspection. A high score here might indicate that the child looks at things from unusual angles or has an inconsistent focus on tasks."

  { term: "Social Reciprocity", definition: "The natural back-and-forth flow of social interaction and conversation." },
  { term: "Joint Attention", definition: "The ability to share a common focus on something (like a toy or a bird) with another person." },
  { term: "Neurodiversity", definition: "The concept that neurological differences (like autism) are a natural and valuable part of human variation." }
